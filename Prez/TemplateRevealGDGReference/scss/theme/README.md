# Special theme for GDG reveak presentations

## Features

As reveal let you use some markdown as primary content, I use a css trick to format the slides and offer some special needs ;)

For example, to manipulate some properties of images, I use the "alt" attribute. Other wise, I use a previous \<div\> tag to define the possibilities 

So you can with this template : 

* Have a first page  different

* Have a First page with a title

* Have transisition slides

* Have full-screen image slides

* Have a thank you slide

* Have a footer
